You are absolutely right. I apologize—I misunderstood your proposed flow.

What you have described is a two-step registration process, and it is an excellent and very secure pattern. You've correctly identified the core principle: verify the email before creating the final user account.

This is a different, and in many ways more robust, model than the single-step registration I outlined before. Let's build out your idea correctly, because it solves the "chicken and the egg" problem in a very elegant way.

The Correct Implementation of Your Two-Step Flow
To make your idea work, we can't just have a floating emailValidated boolean. We need a temporary place to store the verification request. This is typically a new database table.

Let's call it PendingVerifications.

PendingVerifications Table Columns:

id (PK)

email (TEXT, UNIQUE)

verification_token (TEXT)

expires_at (TIMESTAMP)

Now, here is the complete, secure workflow based on your excellent idea:

Step 1: User Submits Email (New "Pre-Registration" Endpoint)
The user first sees a form with only one field: "Email Address".

Endpoint: POST /api/register/initiate

Request Body: { "email": "user@example.com" }

Backend Logic:

Validate that the input is a correctly formatted email.

Crucial Check: Look in the main Users table. Does a user with this email already exist? If yes, return an error: "This email is already registered. Please log in or use the 'Forgot Password' link."

Generate a unique, unguessable verification_token.

Create a new record in the PendingVerifications table with the user's email, the token, and an expiry time (e.g., 15 minutes).

Send an email to the user. The email contains a link to your front-end registration page, with the token as a query parameter: https://yourapp.com/register?token=abc123...

Return a success message: "A verification link has been sent to your email address."

Step 2: User Clicks the Link and Fills Out Details
The user opens their email and clicks the link.

They land on your full registration page (/register). Your front-end app (React, Vue, etc.) sees the token in the URL.

The form now shows the email address (pre-filled and read-only) and asks for the rest of the details: Password, First Name, Last Name, etc.

Step 3: User Submits Full Details (createUser Endpoint)
This is your final createUser step. The user has filled out the form and clicks "Create My Account".

Endpoint: POST /api/register/complete (or your original /users endpoint)

Request Body:

{
  "verificationToken": "abc123...", // Sent from the front-end
  "password": "their-strong-password",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}
Use code with caution.
Json
Backend Logic (createUser Service):

Find the record in the PendingVerifications table that matches the verificationToken.

Security Checks:

If no record is found, or if it has expired -> throw an error: "This verification link is invalid or has expired."

If the token is valid, you now have the verified email address from the PendingVerifications table.

You can now proceed with the original logic: hash the password and create the final record in the Users table.

After successfully creating the user, delete the record from the PendingVerifications table to prevent it from being used again.

Log the new user in and return a success response.

Summary: You were right!
Your proposed flow is superior for security and data quality. It guarantees that the userName (email) in your Users table is always a real, accessible email address.

Your Flow (Two-Step)	My Previous Flow (Single-Step)
Pros: Very high security. Guarantees email ownership. Prevents typo-related account lockouts.	Pros: Lower user friction. Simpler to implement (no extra table/endpoints ).
Cons: More complex to build. Higher friction for the user (they must switch to their email and back).	Cons: A user can create an account with a typo and get locked out forever.
For any application where account recovery is important, your proposed two-step flow is the gold standard. It's more work to implement, but it creates a much more robust and user-friendly system in the long run.
